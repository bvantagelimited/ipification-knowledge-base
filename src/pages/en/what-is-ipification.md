title: What is IPification

---

## What is the meaning of IPification?

The name IPification is derived from two words – IP (referring to internet protocol) and Identification. The name describes our solution in a nutshell – providing advanced Mobile Authentication solution that relies on the IP addresses of the Mobile user. Our registered trade mark aligns with IPification is GMiD – Global Mobile ID.


## What is the GMiD?

It is a trademark we registered for our software box that needs to be deployed on the operators' core network side. GMiD box is actually an MNO's server (their virtual or physical LINUX OS machine inside their core network), where our solution are installed in order to provide needed authentication capability.


## Is IPification Mobile Connect compliant? 

Since November of 2018, IPification is Mobile Connect compliant. Any Service Provider/Merchant that has Mobile Connect protocol integrated can use IPification authentication as well. In addition, IPification also exposes Open ID Connect protocol to SPs as well in case they do not have MC protocol integrated/used before


We are working closely with the GSMA team in London, to extend the coverage of IPification to as many operators as possible globally. Some top IT companies have growing interests in using such service for seamless and secure authentication. At the moment, Mobile Connect gateways, which only provides one of the following Authenticators, encounter big challenges on the security, UX or distribution: 

- **Header Enrichment** (only works on HTTP!)
- **USSD** (requires user opt-in for the channel)
- **SMS with embedded URL** (SS7 vulnerability and bad UX)
- **Sim Applet** (very hard for distribution and large user adoption)


Mobile Apps which are failing short either on user experience or security. That's why almost all Mobile Connect deployments so far, couldn't manage to get commercialized and open up new revenue streams for Operators. We are changing this with IPification.


IPification is set to be an additional and potentially the best method (in terms of UX, privacy & security) for user authentication, as long as the user is on Cellular Data's network (2G, 3G, 4G etc.)

IPification can be also as a standalone API business of Telecom, independent of Mobile Connect, but if you already have MC deployed, we can add it easily as one of the authentication layers which can be heavily monetized.MC Link (Channel partner of Mobile Connect and GSMA) is one of the first merchants/aggregators to buy IPification auth, as soon as it is available with any Telecom. They already aligned a dozen of global merchants who are ready to use it.


## How could IPification replace Login ID and password?

IPification provides seamless and credential-less login authentication solution in partnership with Telecom operators globally. With the IPification solution implemented by service providers, Users will not need to remember their Login IDs or passwords ever again.


## Does IPification need to get support from Major Telecoms and online platforms to be popularized?

IPification solution relies technically on the Telco network. Cooperation with Telco is necessary to deploy this solution in the market. We believe that Telecom operators are in the best position (and possess the best network) to take a leading position in providing seamless authentication globally.

## How many countries IPification currently supports?

IPification is currently focused on covering APAC markets with the focus on North APAC & SEA, but it is constantly working to expand its coverage globally.

## How could general users apply for IPification?

General users do not need to apply for IPification. They can use it as long as their service providers (apps, websites) are supported by the IPification solution.

## Is it a must to use IPification on Mobile devices? Can it be used on computer?

IPification supports login via laptop/desktop/tablet devices as well as login via QR code scan options with your mobile devices (similar to WeChat desktop or WhatsApp desktop usage experience). Mobile device is needed for authentication, since IPification is based on the Mobile Data Users’ IP addresses.
 
##  When all login is relied on IPification, would it cause troubles to end users if they lost their phones? How could you solve the problem?

If the users lost their phones, the same procedure would apply as if they had lost their credit cards. They would need to call and inform their Telecom providers (or IPification support team) to suspend their SIM cards. Think about this: if you lose your phone now, you would need to change 20+ different usernames/passwords combinations in order to protect your current App accounts. If you had used IPificaiton, only one call with the Operator would save you from all the hassle.
 
##  If the mobile device is being lost or stolen, would it cause a bigger problem than traditional login method?

NO, these extreme cases are actually much easier to deal with if you have IPification as your main authentication option. Once you get a new SIM card (with same MSISDN) in the new device you can easily login with the same user experience (one click) as you’ve done before the device was lost.
 
##  If the mobile device is hacked would end user lose all account information?

No, the IPification solution is impossible to be hacked. At the moment, it is the most secure solution in the market. Users will not lose their account information since their account information is not stored in the device.
 
##  When IPification would be launched?

IPification is being integrated by a dozen of leading Telcos in the region and some of the top service providers and channel partners. It is expected that IPification will be implemented by the end of 2018.
 
##  Which Telecoms and merchants have agreed to adopt IPification?
A:    	We will announce accordingly after detailed arrangements are confirmed.
 
##  	What are the revenue sources of IPification?

Main revenue for IPification comes from the revenue shared with the operators on each authentication transaction passing through the GMiD Box, the software solution deployed on the operator side.
 
##  Do users need to pay to use IPification?

No, this solution is completely free for end users. Service providers (Merchants) are paying for this authentication method directly to the operators for each successful transaction.
 
##  As Mobile Connect from GSMA is providing Mobile Identity authentication, why would we need IPification?

Mobile Connect is the GSMA Mobile Identity initiative and IPification has just recently become its compliant vendor and one of their strongest partners and advocates. Up to now, Mobile Connect has been relying mainly on old Telco technologies for authentication – SMS, USSD, Header Enrichment etc. With IPification in place, the Mobile Connect initiative will be properly reinforced as a global initiative.
 

##  Where is IPification R&D based?

There are three R&D centers based in Hong Kong, Vietnam & Serbia

##  What is the difference between IPification and other authentication options?

There are significant differences (advantages) compared to traditional authentication options which mostly relies still on standard email/password login options, phone number verification etc. The main advantages are reflected in much higher security factors being implemented behind IPification, seamless end user experience and affordable pricing.

##  Is IPification safer than Biometric (FaceID, TouchID…) solutions?

Biometric solutions are cool, but unfortunately are not good enough to cope with rising privacy and security challenges in digital ecosystem. There are very poor standards around biometric solutions nowadays and most of them are not 100% reliable due to different external influences (noise, light etc.). Having said this, we do believe that IPification is a strong complementary solution to any biometric ID out there, which will help to fill the above-mentioned gaps. 

##  What is the business use case?

For Public Application, merchants are interested in using IPification as a seamless method for Phone Number verification. (without the need for using insecure and not convenient SMS OTPs)
In addition, via IPification's Mobile ID (hashed combined values of IMSI, IMEI, MSISDN, Service URI), Service Providers can detect seamlessly any changes related to User's SIM or Mobile Device (which could indicate SIM Swapping or any other potentially fraudulent activities). Fintech, Insurtech and Banking industry is especially interested for these security capabilities. 

For Internal Application, most of the MNOs add IPification:
 - as the authentication method for their internal self-care app  
 - as secure and seamless authentication for Direct Carrier Billing gateway (since HE is causing a lot of fraudulent transaction, a lot of complaints and bad UX when User is seeing NOT SECURE in most of the browsers during transaction confirmation)

##  What happen when the customer connects by WiFi, where telcos HE doesn’t work?

From user standpoint experience is the same as with Telcos HE (Header
Enrichment) solution, but the main difference is that this solution works on HTTPS (while HE can only work on HTTP) and this represents one of the main need from today's service providers and merchants, since both Google Play and Apple Store are about to ban all HTTP requests for their apps.
In addition to HTTPS, unique Mobile ID value Operator's will create (hashed value of
MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI) and send to us, also helps fighting some of the most popular frauds today - SIM Swapping, Fake accounts etc. thus bringing much bigger value for Merchants who are ready to pay for such secure seamless authentication service.
During first time registration/login user must use Operator's 3G/4G mobile data connection, so Mobile ID can be generated. Later on, Merchant can validate Mobile ID value also if Customer is on WIFI as well.

##  What are the requirements for interoperability and service coverage?

Many customers (including some of the top IT companies from US & Asia) are interested in using IPification as a seamless authentication for any operator that enables this capability from Day 1. 
For every customer/SP we enable Coverage API to check whether the IPification is available for specific user based on the Public IP - Port values. If IPification is available, they can use it. If it's not, they can return to the traditional methods of authentication, i.e. email/password, OTPs, etc. 

##  How is the progress for standardization process in GSMA and adaptation rate for other telcos? 

We are working closely with GSMA team to make IPification as a standard authentication method for operators, especially in the upcoming 5G roll-out, where most of the users will stay on Cellular data due to speed/accessibility (not switching to WIFI at all). Of course, this is a long process. We are not losing time and already started with IPification implementation with over 75+ operators globally.  

##  What are the work flow to install IPification in a telco infrastructure?

Telco needs to setup one VM/server inside their network (GMID Box) and install our software packages. Then, telco needs to direct logging of Radius Acct (from GGSN/AAA) and Syslog (CGN) messages to GMiD Box. 
 
##  What is the commercial model?

There are 3 models that we are formalizing. 
 
Model 1. The first one is the default one. Vast number of international SPs and channel partners signed this agreement to use IPification. They are paying for this type of authentication to us, we keep the margin and we pay 60-65% of the SPs price to the MNO. There are two pricing models defined with SPs: 
a) pay per for every Mobile ID authentication 
b) pay per Mobile ID / daily 
 
Model 2. MNO can sell this service directly via MC channel or outside MC as a standalone service as well. In this case MNO keeps ~90% of the SP's price, we are entitled for 10% for the maintenance fee. 
In this case Operators are signing agreements directly with Merchants/Service Providers, collect the revenue (service fee) and pay to IPification (BVL) a "transaction fee" as a maintenance fee for technology (GMiD box) provided.
 
Note: technology and service are FREE OF CHARGE for Operators’ use for their internal services - self-care apps, entertainment apps, seamless subscribers onboarding etc.    

The only thing operators needs to do on their side is to Install GMID software box
 
Model 3. MNO uses this technology free of charge for any internal service. 

##  Use case of Hashed Mobile ID

MobileID is network generated Identity (User) Token with validity based on Device and SIM combination consistency.
Service providers use it as additional UserID near Phone Number or Username. Based on a security level of application/service, service providers use it as Single or Additional (Second) factor authentication.

##  What will happen in case that end customer change their SIM card or change their handset? (Mobile ID will be changed). Does end customer still be allowed to use service? 

User will be able to use the service. User just needs to register new MobileID with the service. In case of Single factor authentication, user just needs to assign new MobileID to Account/Phone Number. In case of two factor authentication, user needs to confirm this change with username/password. It is possible to assign more MobileID with same account, which allows user to use same service on different devices and with different SIMs (dual sim, holiday sim...).

##  Does IPification’s Mobile ID will be used only as 2nd factor in Multi Factor Authentication with service provider? 

Depends on service. If we are talking about Banks then yes, IPification is used as Second Factor. But if we are talking about Chat apps (Whatsapp, Viber...) IPification can be the only authentication method.

##  Does Mobile ID be collected at registration/subscription stage as well? 
A;	MobileID is usually assigned with an account in registration process. But it can be added in any later phase.

##  Is there any use case that IPification will be used as Single Factor Authentication? 

Mostly, chat apps use IPification as Single Factor. All apps which use Phone Number as user identifier, Viber, Whatsapp, can use IPification as the solely authentication method. 

##  How should different type of Login be used for different types of application?

Anonymous Login
Any application which wants to allow user to try and then to register if user is satisfied. Usually Games and E-Commerce. They register user as anonymous and keep everything about user, statuses, scores, shop cart, etc. and user can consume the service until decides to register.

Phone Login
Any application which uses Phone Number as user identifier. Usually Chat Apps, but also can be Games, Banks...


Phone verification   
Any service which collects Phone Number from the users. Even service uses Phone Number as UserID (Chat Apps) or just as additional attribute of user Account (Banks)

##  What is the estimation of revenue growth rate ? 
Phase 1 : initialze 
Phase 2 : 112% growth over Phase 1
Phase 3 : 42% growth over Phase 2

UK is one of the best market for this type of authentication as confirmed by the most recent discussions and interest we received from the Fintech space. Companies like LexisNexis, HSBC etc. (Google and Microsoft are super keen to integrate this as soon as it is available with any MNO). 
 
The numbers shared in the proposal are derived from our internal algorithms used and based on the discussion with all the prospects we currently have in the pipe either directly or through our channel partners. If it is needed for you, I can ask my commercial team to prepare monthly projections over 2 years span (as all 3 Phases are spanning over 2 years), so more detailed expectations can be assessed.
