##  Do you need to access the local GMiD box for upgrade, maintenance , etc? 

In general, you can do all installation, upgrade and maintenance by yourself. It requires more knowledge from your side, but it not rocket science. GMiDBox is software solution and you can do everything or you can give us permissions to do all those things for you. 
There are standard tasks we/you need to do: upgrade, maintenance, troubleshooting.

##  When we need to update Public IP process, what is the update procedure? 

GMiDBox has special Web Management Console for Accounts, Statistics, Reporting, and also Settings, where IP Range is included. Based on it GMiDBox reject any API request which is not from that ranges. There is also API by which this list can be retrieved. 
So, when you change the IP List, you just edit Settings inside GMiDBox Console and IPification will get it very soon by polling updated list.
